# Contribution Policies

These rules apply to all contributors and all repos changes.

## 1) Issue First, Then PR

- Create a GitHub issue **before** opening a pull request.
- Reference the issue in the PR description using `Closes #<issue-number>` (or `Refs #<issue-number>` when not closing).
- If a PR has no linked issue, it is out of policy and should be updated before review.

## 2) Document Standing Instructions Promptly

When fourmajor gives a standing instruction (phrases like "in the future", "always", "from now on"):

- Add the rule to project documentation immediately in the same workstream.
- Keep the instruction concise, actionable, and easy to find.
- Add or update links from top-level docs (like `README.md`) when discoverability is needed.

## Quick Checklist

Before requesting review:

- [ ] Related issue exists.
- [ ] PR links the issue (`Closes #...` / `Refs #...`).
- [ ] Any new standing instruction has been documented.
