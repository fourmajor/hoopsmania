# Run Locally

Use this section as the entry point for local development setup.

## First 15 minutes

1. Clone the repository.
2. Pick the service you want to run first (backend, then frontend).
3. Follow the service run guide exactly.
4. Verify health with a simple request or service health endpoint.
5. Keep this doc open as your local runbook index.

## Guides

- Backend quickstart: `docs/run/backend-local.md`
- Development configuration: `docs/run/configuration.md`

## As the project grows

Add new service runbooks under `docs/run/`, for example:

- `docs/run/frontend-local.md`
- `docs/run/worker-local.md`
- `docs/run/database-local.md`

Keep each guide focused on:

- prerequisites
- setup
- run command
- verification
- troubleshooting
