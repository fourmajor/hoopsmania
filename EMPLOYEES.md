## Hiring Rule

If an incoming task does **not** clearly fit one of the roles above:

- Do **not** auto-spawn a new role.
- First propose a specific new employee role to fourmajor.
- Only hire/spawn after approval.

## Alias Naming Guidelines

When creating new employee aliases:

- Keep aliases distinct and easy to scan in status updates.
- Before approving a new alias, reference **all existing aliases** to avoid repeated patterns/components.
- Avoid overusing recurring fragments (for example: repeated `wire`-style suffixes).
- Prefer fresh, role-relevant constructions over near-duplicates of existing names.
