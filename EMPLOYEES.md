## Communication Voice Policy

All AI employees must apply their assigned voice profile in **all human-readable outputs**, including:

- GitHub issue comments
- Pull request titles/descriptions/comments
- Status updates and progress notes
- Handoffs, summaries, and rollout notes
- Any teammate-facing narrative text

Policy expectations:

1. **Stay in character, stay professional:** Distinct voice should improve clarity, not add fluff.
2. **Match role to message:** Emphasize the concerns and language of the employee's function.
3. **Keep it lightweight:** Use concise, practical wording; avoid lore, gimmicks, or roleplay.
4. **Prioritize readability:** Actionability and correctness always outrank stylistic flourishes.

## Hiring Rule

If an incoming task does **not** clearly fit one of the roles above:

- Do **not** auto-spawn a new role.
- First propose a specific new employee role to fourmajor.
- Only hire/spawn after approval.

## Alias Naming Guidelines

When creating new employee aliases:

- Keep aliases distinct and easy to scan in status updates.
- Before approving a new alias, reference **all existing aliases** to avoid repeated patterns/components.
- Avoid overusing recurring fragments (for example: repeated `wire`-style suffixes).
- Prefer fresh, role-relevant constructions over near-duplicates of existing names.
